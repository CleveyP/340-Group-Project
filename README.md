# 340-Group-Project
group project where we work with a csv file of movies and try to answer some research questions in c++
This is our group proposal:
Project title: “A Study of the Current Popular Movies and those Actors who Influence Said Popularity”
 
The list of team members who work on this proposal:     
Ronnie Huang, Zuriel Respicio, Cleveland Plonsey, Yueling Liu, Danial Javed, Stephen Martel 
A brief description of the following:
Which dataset? 
The movie Data Set


What are the problems that your team is going to address in this project?
Problem 1: Which of the top ten actors by occurrence brings in the most revenue?
	Edit: Example: Only count the first 5 listed actors (dataset appears to be in descending order of role importance), and associate the revenue of the movie to that actor’s name. 
Possible further expansion: Calculate the average revenue of movies the actor was named in the first 5 roles, and then sort the completed list of average revenues by actor.
Problem 2: Which types of movies are popular over time (based on revenue and ratings)
Edit: I think this should be rephrased as “Which types of movies are popular by generation (yearly brackets)” or “How do the currently popular movies change over time (pop culture)”.
	Edit again: By generation I mean, “Highest revenue movies of the 1990’s” or “Highest rated movies from 2000 to 2005”. Could be related to cast as well, like the first problem, (average) highest grossing actor of 2010, or highest rated actor by leading role (first listed in credits).
Edit: Possible example: In certain year brackets (5 or 10 years), sort movies by highest revenue, or by highest rating. The dataset does not specify revenue earned per year, only the total revenue sum of a movie, so we have to limit the year bracket.

Why are we interested in this problem?
	Movies are a multimillion dollar industry that not only affects our economy, but also impacts our culture. Noticing trends in popular movies can inform us on what our culture is gravitating towards (where we are now and what new values our culture is embracing (where we are going)
For an example of end goals, we could answer a director’s question:
“Who should we hire for our next movie?”
“What kind of movie will people actually watch these days?”
“I want this to absolutely bomb at the box office, what’s the worst possible combination of actors and genres that can make my film “so bad it’s good”? ”
“If I cast Nicolas Cage for every role will I make money?”
