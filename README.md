What are the problems that your team is going to address in this project?
A brief description of the following:
In this project, our two research questions / problems will be:
Problem 1: Which are the main actors involved in the highest grossing movies 


Problem 2: What kinds of genres are popular in that year range?
Get every movie of one genre, revenue, and rating
Calculate popularity by “rating * (revenue / (10^5)”
Kinds by (genre/ company) over time by release date


Why are we interested in this problem?

Movies are a multimillion dollar industry that not only affects our economy, but also impacts our culture. Noticing trends in popular movies can inform us on what our culture is gravitating towards (where we are now and what new values our culture is embracing (where we are going)

For an example of end goals, we could answer a director’s question:
“Who should we hire for our next movie?”
“What kind of movie will people actually watch these days?”
“I want this to absolutely bomb at the box office, what’s the worst possible combination of actors and genres that can make my film “so bad it’s good”? ”
“If I cast Nicolas Cage for every role will I make money?”
