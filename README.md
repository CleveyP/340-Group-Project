# 340-Group-Project
group project where we work with a csv file of movies and try to answer some research questions in c++
This is our group proposal:
Project title: “A Study of the Current Popular Movies and those Actors who Influence Said Popularity”
 
The list of team members who work on this proposal:     
Ronnie Huang, Zuriel Respicio, Cleveland Plonsey, Yueling Liu, Danial Javed, Stephen Martel 
A brief description of the following:
Which dataset? 
The movie Data Set


What are the problems that your team is going to address in this project?
A brief description of the following:
In this project,our two research questions/ problems will be:
Problem 1:of the top ten actors by occurrence, which one seems to bring in the revenue
Actor and revenue
Problem 2: what kinds of genres are popular in terms of revenue and ratings (2017)
Get every movie of one genre, revenue, and rating
Calculate popularity by “rating * (revenue / (10^5)”
Kinds by (genre/ company) over time by release date
Movies are a multimillion dollar industry that not only affects our economy, but also impacts our culture. Noticing trends in popular movies can inform us on what our culture is gravitating towards (where we are now and what new values our culture is embracing (where we are going)
Which genre of movie appeals to which demographic (youth, adult, seniors) the most? THIS ONE CANNOT BE ANSWERED WITH THE CSV FILE. 


Why are we interested in this problem?
	Movies are a multimillion dollar industry that not only affects our economy, but also impacts our culture. Noticing trends in popular movies can inform us on what our culture is gravitating towards (where we are now and what new values our culture is embracing (where we are going)
For an example of end goals, we could answer a director’s question:
“Who should we hire for our next movie?”
“What kind of movie will people actually watch these days?”
“I want this to absolutely bomb at the box office, what’s the worst possible combination of actors and genres that can make my film “so bad it’s good”? ”
“If I cast Nicolas Cage for every role will I make money?”
